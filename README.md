# Code to reproduce: "Formation of the First Two Black Hole – Neutron Star Mergers (GW200115 and GW200105) from Isolated Binary Evolution" https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05763 
This is a publicly available Github repostitory to recreate all the results and figures from the manuscript "Formation of the First Two Black Hole – Neutron Star Mergers (GW200115 and GW200105) from Isolated Binary Evolution" by Floor S. Broekgaarden and Edo Berger (subm. to ApJ, https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05763). 

The repostitory is structured as follows 


## Reproducing Figure 1:

#### Fig 1. Data:

To recreate Figure 1 you will need the following .csv files
 - rates_MSSFR_Models_BHBH_AllDCOsimulation.csv # 22.9 kB
 - rates_MSSFR_Models_BHNS_AllDCOsimulation.csv # 22.9 kB
 - rates_MSSFR_Models_NSNS_AllDCOsimulation.csv # 22.9 kB


that are available in the directory
